# MARBeL: A Model-based Approach using Recursive Belief-based Learning for Solving Imperfect Information Mind Sports
Welcome to the repository for the thesis project, MARBeL, which utilizes a model-based algorithm that combines self-play reinforcement learning and search to solve imperfect information
mind sports. This project is divided into three distinct components:
1. [MARBeL Algorithm](https://github.com/Thesis-GOTG/MARBeL) – the proposed algorithm for solving imperfect information mind sports
2. [Training Repository](https://github.com/Thesis-GOTG/training) – contains the different model versions that were trained and their results
3. [Game of the Generals Game](https://github.com/Thesis-GOTG/gog) – Playable implementation of the Game of the Generals game using the trained model.
